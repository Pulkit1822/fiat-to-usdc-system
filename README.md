## Technical Detailed Component Architecture

### Overview

This document provides a detailed overview of the technical component architecture for the production-ready system for converting fiat currency to USDC through a centralized treasury. The architecture focuses on security, reliability, and scalability, and includes all necessary components from user interaction to blockchain integration.

### Key Components and Architecture

#### 1. Treasury Wallet
A secure wallet holding the USDC that will be sent to users after receiving fiat payments. It should be multi-sig or use some form of heightened security (especially for large transfers).

#### 2. Fiat Bank Account (Onramp)
A bank account where users send their fiat. The system will need a reliable way to detect deposits in real-time (via webhook, API integration with the bank, or batch reconciliation).

#### 3. Liquidity Pool (Rebalancing)
The liquidity pool ensures that you have enough USDC to fulfill user requests without draining your treasury wallet. The liquidity pool can be internally managed or connected to external liquidity sources.

#### 4. User Wallets
The destination for the fiat-onramp user’s USDC after rebalancing.

#### 5. Reconciliation System
Tracks all deposits and transactions to ensure that there’s no discrepancy between the fiat received and USDC sent. The system needs a mechanism for comparing bank account records, treasury balances, and user wallet transactions.

#### 6. Transaction Monitoring System
Monitors the state of the blockchain to ensure the USDC transfer is successful. This system should also handle retries for failed transactions.

## Transaction Flow Patterns

### Overview

This section provides a detailed overview of the transaction flow patterns for the production-ready system for converting fiat currency to USDC through a centralized treasury. The flow patterns focus on security, reliability, and scalability, and include all necessary components from user interaction to blockchain integration.

### Transaction Flow

#### User Sends Fiat to Bank
- The user initiates a fiat transfer to your bank account.
- You would need to track this transaction in real-time or via batch reconciliation.

#### Fiat Deposit Notification
- The system (via API or webhook) receives notification when fiat is deposited into the bank account.
- The amount deposited is verified against user information (e.g., deposit reference).

#### Fiat to USDC Conversion
- Upon verification, the system ensures sufficient liquidity exists in the treasury or liquidity pool.
- You then rebalance the fiat deposit into USDC from the liquidity pool or treasury.

#### USDC Transfer to User’s Wallet
- The equivalent amount of USDC is sent from the treasury wallet (or liquidity pool) to the user’s wallet on-chain.
- Transaction is logged for transparency and tracking.

#### Confirmation and Reconciliation
- Once the transfer is completed, both the bank and blockchain transactions should be reconciled.
- You verify that the amount of USDC matches the fiat deposited and update the internal ledger.

## Reconciliation Algorithms

### Overview

This section provides a detailed overview of the reconciliation algorithms for the production-ready system for converting fiat currency to USDC through a centralized treasury.

#### Step 4: Transfer USDC
- The equivalent amount of USDC is sent from the treasury wallet (or liquidity pool) to the user’s wallet on-chain.
- Transaction is logged for transparency and tracking.

#### Step 5: Reconcile Transactions

Push the built Docker images to your container registry. Run the following command for each image:

```sh
docker push <container-registry>/<image-name>:<tag>
```

Replace `<container-registry>` with the URL of your container registry, `<image-name>` with the name of the microservice, and `<tag>` with the desired tag.

#### 3. Update Kubernetes Configuration

Update the Kubernetes configuration files (`infrastructure/kubernetes-configuration.yaml`) with the correct image names and tags. Ensure that the `image` field for each container points to the correct container registry, image name, and tag.

#### 4. Apply Kubernetes Configuration

Apply the updated Kubernetes configuration to deploy the microservices to your Kubernetes cluster. Run the following command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes-configuration.yaml
```

#### 5. Verify Deployment

Verify that the microservices are deployed and running correctly. Run the following command to check the status of the deployments:

```sh
kubectl get deployments -n fiat-to-usdc
```

Ensure that all deployments have the desired number of replicas and are in a healthy state.

#### 6. Set Up Monitoring

Set up monitoring for the deployed system. Refer to the `infrastructure/monitoring-setup.md` document for detailed instructions on configuring Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack.

#### 7. Configure CI/CD Pipeline

Configure the CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Refer to the `infrastructure/ci-cd-pipelines.yaml` file for the pipeline configuration.

All communication between system components is secured using secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, WSS) to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

#### 6. Secure Coding Practices
The system follows secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities and ensure the security of the codebase. Regular code reviews and security audits are conducted to identify and address potential security issues.

#### 7. Regular Security Audits
Regular security audits are conducted to assess the security posture of the system and identify potential vulnerabilities. The audits include penetration testing, code reviews, and vulnerability assessments.

#### 8. Data Protection and Privacy
The system complies with data protection and privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) to ensure the protection of user data. Data is stored securely and access is restricted to authorized personnel only.

#### 9. Incident Response Plan
An incident response plan is in place to handle security incidents effectively. The plan includes procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents.

#### 10. Backup and Disaster Recovery
Regular backups are performed to ensure data availability and integrity. A disaster recovery plan is in place to ensure the system can recover from catastrophic events and continue operations.

### Security Protocols

#### 1. Authentication and Authorization
- User authentication is performed using secure methods (e.g., OAuth, JWT).
- Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to restrict access to sensitive resources based on user roles and permissions.

#### 2. Data Encryption
- Data at rest is encrypted using strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
- Data in transit is encrypted using secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL).

#### 3. Key Management
- Cryptographic keys are managed securely using a Hardware Security Module (HSM).
- Key rotation and revocation procedures are in place to ensure the security of cryptographic keys.

#### 4. Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- Security is integrated into the development lifecycle, from design to deployment.
- Regular security training is provided to developers to ensure they are aware of secure coding practices and potential security threats.

#### 5. Monitoring and Logging
- Real-time monitoring and logging are implemented to detect and respond to security incidents.
- Audit logs are maintained to provide a record of security-related events and activities.

### Compliance

#### 1. GDPR Compliance
The system complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to ensure the protection of user data and privacy.

#### 2. Financial Regulations
The system complies with relevant financial regulations to ensure the security and integrity of financial transactions.
