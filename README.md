## Technical Detailed Component Architecture

### Overview

This document provides a detailed overview of the technical component architecture for the production-ready system for converting fiat currency to USDC through a centralized treasury. The architecture focuses on security, reliability, and scalability, and includes all necessary components from user interaction to blockchain integration.

### Key Components and Architecture

#### 1. Treasury Wallet
A secure wallet holding the USDC that will be sent to users after receiving fiat payments. It should be multi-sig or use some form of heightened security (especially for large transfers).

#### 2. Fiat Bank Account (Onramp)
A bank account where users send their fiat. The system will need a reliable way to detect deposits in real-time (via webhook, API integration with the bank, or batch reconciliation).

#### 3. Liquidity Pool (Rebalancing)
The liquidity pool ensures that you have enough USDC to fulfill user requests without draining your treasury wallet. The liquidity pool can be internally managed or connected to external liquidity sources.

#### 4. User Wallets
The destination for the fiat-onramp user’s USDC after rebalancing.

#### 5. Reconciliation System
Tracks all deposits and transactions to ensure that there’s no discrepancy between the fiat received and USDC sent. The system needs a mechanism for comparing bank account records, treasury balances, and user wallet transactions.

#### 6. Transaction Monitoring System
Monitors the state of the blockchain to ensure the USDC transfer is successful. This system should also handle retries for failed transactions.

### Component Diagrams

## Transaction Flow Patterns

### Overview

This section provides a detailed overview of the transaction flow patterns for the production-ready system for converting fiat currency to USDC through a centralized treasury. The flow patterns focus on security, reliability, and scalability, and include all necessary components from user interaction to blockchain integration.

### Transaction Flow

#### User Sends Fiat to Bank
- The user initiates a fiat transfer to your bank account.
- You would need to track this transaction in real-time or via batch reconciliation.

#### Fiat Deposit Notification
- The system (via API or webhook) receives notification when fiat is deposited into the bank account.
- The amount deposited is verified against user information (e.g., deposit reference).

#### Fiat to USDC Conversion
- Upon verification, the system ensures sufficient liquidity exists in the treasury or liquidity pool.
- You then rebalance the fiat deposit into USDC from the liquidity pool or treasury.

#### USDC Transfer to User’s Wallet
- The equivalent amount of USDC is sent from the treasury wallet (or liquidity pool) to the user’s wallet on-chain.
- Transaction is logged for transparency and tracking.

#### Confirmation and Reconciliation
- Once the transfer is completed, both the bank and blockchain transactions should be reconciled.
- You verify that the amount of USDC matches the fiat deposited and update the internal ledger.

## Reconciliation Algorithms

### Overview

This section provides a detailed overview of the reconciliation algorithms for the production-ready system for converting fiat currency to USDC through a centralized treasury. The algorithms focus on security, reliability, and scalability, and include all necessary components from user interaction to blockchain integration.

### Reconciliation Process

#### Step 1: Track Deposits
- The system tracks all fiat deposits made to the bank account in real-time or via batch reconciliation.

#### Step 2: Verify Deposits
- The system verifies the amount deposited against user information (e.g., deposit reference).

#### Step 3: Rebalance USDC
- The system ensures sufficient liquidity exists in the treasury or liquidity pool.
- The fiat deposit is rebalanced into USDC from the liquidity pool or treasury.

#### Step 4: Transfer USDC
- The equivalent amount of USDC is sent from the treasury wallet (or liquidity pool) to the user’s wallet on-chain.
- Transaction is logged for transparency and tracking.

#### Step 5: Reconcile Transactions
- The system reconciles both the bank and blockchain transactions to ensure there are no discrepancies.
- The internal ledger is updated to reflect the reconciled transactions.
