# Cloud Architecture Setup

This document outlines the cloud architecture setup for the production-ready system for converting fiat currency to USDC through a centralized treasury. The setup focuses on security, reliability, and scalability.

## Cloud Provider

The system can be deployed on any of the following cloud providers:
- AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
- Azure (Microsoft Azure)

## Architecture Components

### 1. Microservices

The system is designed using a microservices architecture. Each service is responsible for a specific functionality and can be deployed, scaled, and managed independently.

### 2. Kubernetes

Kubernetes is used for container orchestration. It manages the deployment, scaling, and operation of the microservices.

### 3. CI/CD Pipelines

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are set up to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

### 4. Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring and logging are essential for maintaining the health and performance of the system. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) are used for this purpose.

### 5. Security

Security is a critical aspect of the system. The following measures are implemented:
- End-to-end encryption
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration
- Multi-factor authentication
- Rate limiting and fraud detection

## Network Architecture

The network architecture includes the following components:
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Subnets (public and private)
- Load balancers
- Security groups
- NAT gateways

## Database

The system uses a combination of relational and NoSQL databases to store data. The databases are deployed in a highly available and scalable manner.

## Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery planning is essential to ensure the system's availability and reliability. The following measures are implemented:
- Regular backups
- Multi-region deployment
- Automated failover mechanisms

## High Availability

The system is designed for high availability with the following features:
- Redundant components
- Load balancing
- Auto-scaling

## Conclusion

The cloud architecture setup ensures that the system is secure, reliable, and scalable. It leverages the best practices and tools available to achieve these goals.
