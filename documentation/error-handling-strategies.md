# Error Handling Strategies

## Overview

This document outlines the error handling strategies for the production-ready system for converting fiat currency to USDC through a centralized treasury. The strategies focus on identifying, managing, and recovering from errors to ensure the system's reliability and availability.

## Error Codes

The system uses comprehensive error codes to identify and categorize different types of errors. Each error code is associated with a detailed error message to provide more context about the error.

### Common Error Codes

- `ERR001`: User authentication failed
- `ERR002`: KYC verification failed
- `ERR003`: Wallet creation failed
- `ERR004`: Bank verification failed
- `ERR005`: Fiat deposit detection failed
- `ERR006`: USDC distribution failed
- `ERR007`: Transaction status tracking failed
- `ERR008`: Exchange rate retrieval failed
- `ERR009`: Multi-signature wallet operation failed
- `ERR010`: Liquidity pool operation failed
- `ERR011`: Rebalancing operation failed
- `ERR012`: Risk management operation failed
- `ERR013`: Transaction monitoring failed
- `ERR014`: Alert management failed
- `ERR015`: Reporting failed
- `ERR016`: Analytics failed

## Error Messages

Each error code is associated with a detailed error message to provide more context about the error. The error messages include information about the cause of the error and possible solutions.

### Example Error Messages

- `ERR001`: "User authentication failed. Please check your credentials and try again."
- `ERR002`: "KYC verification failed. Please ensure that your documents are valid and try again."
- `ERR003`: "Wallet creation failed. Please try again later or contact support."
- `ERR004`: "Bank verification failed. Please ensure that your bank details are correct and try again."
- `ERR005`: "Fiat deposit detection failed. Please try again later or contact support."
- `ERR006`: "USDC distribution failed. Please try again later or contact support."
- `ERR007`: "Transaction status tracking failed. Please try again later or contact support."
- `ERR008`: "Exchange rate retrieval failed. Please try again later or contact support."
- `ERR009`: "Multi-signature wallet operation failed. Please try again later or contact support."
- `ERR010`: "Liquidity pool operation failed. Please try again later or contact support."
- `ERR011`: "Rebalancing operation failed. Please try again later or contact support."
- `ERR012`: "Risk management operation failed. Please try again later or contact support."
- `ERR013`: "Transaction monitoring failed. Please try again later or contact support."
- `ERR014`: "Alert management failed. Please try again later or contact support."
- `ERR015`: "Reporting failed. Please try again later or contact support."
- `ERR016`: "Analytics failed. Please try again later or contact support."

## Error Recovery Procedures

The system includes error recovery procedures to handle errors and ensure the system's reliability and availability. The recovery procedures include retry mechanisms, fallback mechanisms, and manual intervention.

### Retry Mechanisms

The system uses retry mechanisms to handle transient errors. If an error occurs, the system retries the operation a specified number of times before failing.

### Fallback Mechanisms

The system uses fallback mechanisms to handle errors that cannot be resolved through retries. If an error occurs, the system falls back to an alternative operation or notifies the user to try again later.

### Manual Intervention

In some cases, errors may require manual intervention to resolve. The system includes procedures for notifying the appropriate teams and providing them with the necessary information to resolve the error.

## Edge Cases

The system is designed to handle edge cases gracefully. Edge cases are scenarios that are not common but can occur and cause errors. The system includes mechanisms for identifying and handling edge cases to ensure the system's reliability and availability.

### Example Edge Cases

- **Transaction Delays**: The system handles transaction delays by retrying the operation and notifying the user if the delay persists.
- **Discrepancies**: The system handles discrepancies by reconciling the data and notifying the appropriate teams if the discrepancy cannot be resolved automatically.
- **Failed Transfers**: The system handles failed transfers by retrying the operation and notifying the user if the transfer cannot be completed.

## Conclusion

The error handling strategies outlined in this document ensure that the system can identify, manage, and recover from errors to maintain its reliability and availability. The strategies include comprehensive error codes, detailed error messages, error recovery procedures, and mechanisms for handling edge cases.
