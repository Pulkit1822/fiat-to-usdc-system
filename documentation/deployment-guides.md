# Deployment Guides

This document provides detailed instructions for deploying the production-ready system for converting fiat currency to USDC through a centralized treasury. The deployment process focuses on security, reliability, and scalability.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the deployment process, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

1. A cloud provider account (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
2. Kubernetes cluster set up and configured
3. Docker installed on your local machine
4. kubectl installed and configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster
5. CI/CD pipeline configured (refer to `infrastructure/ci-cd-pipelines.yaml`)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build Docker Images

First, build the Docker images for each microservice. Navigate to the root directory of each microservice and run the following command:

```sh
docker build -t <image-name>:<tag> .
```

Replace `<image-name>` with the name of the microservice (e.g., user-service) and `<tag>` with the desired tag (e.g., latest).

### 2. Push Docker Images to Container Registry

Push the built Docker images to your container registry. Run the following command for each image:

```sh
docker push <container-registry>/<image-name>:<tag>
```

Replace `<container-registry>` with the URL of your container registry, `<image-name>` with the name of the microservice, and `<tag>` with the desired tag.

### 3. Update Kubernetes Configuration

Update the Kubernetes configuration files (`infrastructure/kubernetes-configuration.yaml`) with the correct image names and tags. Ensure that the `image` field for each container points to the correct container registry, image name, and tag.

### 4. Apply Kubernetes Configuration

Apply the updated Kubernetes configuration to deploy the microservices to your Kubernetes cluster. Run the following command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes-configuration.yaml
```

### 5. Verify Deployment

Verify that the microservices are deployed and running correctly. Run the following command to check the status of the deployments:

```sh
kubectl get deployments -n fiat-to-usdc
```

Ensure that all deployments have the desired number of replicas and are in a healthy state.

### 6. Set Up Monitoring

Set up monitoring for the deployed system. Refer to the `infrastructure/monitoring-setup.md` document for detailed instructions on configuring Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack.

### 7. Configure CI/CD Pipeline

Configure the CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Refer to the `infrastructure/ci-cd-pipelines.yaml` file for the pipeline configuration.

### 8. Perform Initial Tests

Perform initial tests to ensure that the system is functioning correctly. Run unit tests, integration tests, and load tests to validate the deployment. Refer to the `testing` directory for test scripts and configurations.

### 9. Monitor and Maintain

Continuously monitor the system's performance and health. Set up alerts and dashboards to track key metrics and respond to any issues promptly. Regularly update the system with security patches and improvements.

## Conclusion

Following these deployment steps ensures that the system is deployed securely, reliably, and scalably. Regular monitoring and maintenance are essential to keep the system running smoothly and efficiently.
